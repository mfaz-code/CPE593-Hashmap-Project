To test the performance of the code and the common hashtable implementation using input size and the hash function used, we can follow these steps:

1. Generate a set of test data with varying input sizes. Can use a tool or library to generate random data.

2. Define the hash function you want to use for the tests. Can experiment with different hash functions to see which one provides the best performance for your specific use case.

3. Time the execution of both implementations for each input size. Can use a profiler or own timing code to measure the elapsed time for each implementation. 
   and make sure to run the tests multiple times and take the average time to get a more accurate result.

4. Analyze the results to determine which implementation performs better.
